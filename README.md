### More 'bout me:
My name is Deyan Sirakov. I started coding back in 2016-17 when I started experimenting with YoYo Games' Game Maker. This Game Engine used a language named GML, that's when I first encountered data types, arrays, variables, etc. My passion for game development was incredible and still pulls me forward to achieve my dreams. Later on I started dabbling with Unity and C#. My knowledge didn't reach such a great level, but I'm still learning. In 2022, I became a part of SoftUni where I learned many intricacies along programming and mastered one of the most amazing languages, Java, at an extremely high level. Today I'm still experimenting with different libraries, frameworks and languages. I'm even already taking my first steps into the world of cybersecurity and ethical hacking.
