I'm just a regular 17 year old kid, who likes to do crazy stuff using his computer science knowledge. I have a lot of knowage on subjects like programming, cybersecurity, cloud engeneering, system administration and more. My favourite languages are Java, C and C++, but I can code on many more :) I would love to colaborate with others and learn new topics on my favourite subjects.
